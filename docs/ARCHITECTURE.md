# Architecture — exploratory

No engine, programming language, storage format, or networking architecture has been chosen.

## Candidate domain concepts
- **Piece**: geometry/visual asset plus transform, bounds, optional grid settings, and zero or more connectors.
- **Connector**: local pose, type/interface, alignment constraints, and compatibility metadata; may be exposed through an assembly.
- **Assembly / Blueprint**: nested pieces and blueprints, local transforms, bounds, and explicitly published external connectors.
- **Scenery pack**: versioned library of assets, piece definitions, styles, and optional assembly templates.
- **Structure / Hull**: immutable or editable geometric envelope and fixed anchor features.
- **Grammar**: constraints and candidate module definitions for generating coherent spaces.
- **World instance**: seed, grammar/pack versions, established geometry, edits, and unresolved frontiers.

## Core invariants
1. All committed physical components fit inside the authoritative structure volume.
2. Existing committed observations and user edits are never silently rewritten.
3. Snap interfaces are optional; grid and free placement remain available.
4. Blueprint composition is recursive; interface exposure is explicit.
5. Generation validates collisions, clearance, connectivity, and remaining hard constraints.
6. A generator may reject a placement or return a valid fallback; it may not cheat geometry.

## Candidate generation lifecycle
Unresolved frontier -> gather local/global constraints -> enumerate compatible modules -> validate volume and connectivity -> select deterministically with a seed/context -> commit geometry and provenance -> persist. The exact deterministic selection method is an open design question.

## Important separations
- Geometry/attachment vs semantics (a snap point need not imply power or fluid transfer).
- Physical piece vs visual skin/material.
- Module library vs runtime instance.
- Hard constraints vs soft aesthetic preferences.
- Observed committed state vs latent possibilities.

## Questions to prototype
- How do inherited and custom connector interfaces coexist?
- What grid resolutions and rotation freedoms are supported?
- How are blueprint bounds and hull occupancy represented?
- How do we guarantee future feasible configurations without prematurely resolving unexplored spaces?
- How do simultaneous explorers avoid conflicting commits?
